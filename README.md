# Numbers
Solution to different numbers.


## 1. Armstrong number

<pre>
Armstrong number is a number in which  the sum of cubes of each digits is equal to the number itself. 
		For example:
				153 = 1* 1 * 1 + 5 * 5 * 5 + 3 * 3 * 3

## 2. Palindromic number

<pre>
A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome) is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
		For example:
				121,11,1331
</pre>

## 3. Perfect number

<pre>
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. 
		For example: 
			6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.
</pre>

## 4. Pronic number

<pre>
Pronic number is a number which is the product of two consecutive integers, that is, a number n is a product of x and (x+1).
		For example:
			6 is a pronic number
			2 * 3 = 6 
			the two consecutive integers are 2 and 3.
</pre>

## 5 Neon number

<pre>
A number is said to be a Neon Number if the sum of digits of the square of the number is equal to the number itself.
		For example:
			9 is a Neon Number. 9*9=81 and 8+1=9.
</pre>

## 6 Co-Prime number

<pre>
Two numbers A and B are said to be Co-Prime or mutually prime if the Greatest Common Divisor of them is 1.
		For example:
			14 and 15
			Factors of 14 are 1,2,7,14
			Factors of 15 are 1,3,5,15
			So the H.C.F is 1
			Therefore they are co-prime.
</pre>

## 7 Harshad number

<pre>
Harshad(Niven Number) is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.
		For example:
			18 is a Harshad number,because the sum of the digits 1 and 8 is 9 (1 + 8 = 9), and 18 is divisible by 9 
			(since 18 % 9 = 0)
</pre>

## 8 Disarium number

<pre>
A number will be called DISARIUM if sum of its digits powered with their respective position is equal to the original number.
		For example:
				135 is a DISARIUM
				(Workings 11+32+53 = 135, some other DISARIUM are 89, 175, 518 etc)
</pre>

## 9 Special number

<pre>
A number is said to be special number when the sum of factorial of its digits is equal to the number itself.
		For example : 
				145 is a Special Number as 1!+4!+5!=145. 
</pre>

## 10 ISBN number

<pre>
The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique numeric book identifier which is printed on every book. The ISBN is based upon a 10-digit code. The ISBN is legal if:
1xdigit1 + 2xdigit2 + 3xdigit3 + 4xdigit4 + 5xdigit5 + 6xdigit6 + 7xdigit7 + 8xdigit8 + 9xdigit9 + 10xdigit10 is divisible by 11.
		For example:1401601499 is an ISBN 
		Sum=1×1 + 2×4 + 3×0 + 4×1 + 5×6 + 6×0 + 7×1 + 8×4 + 9×9 + 10×9 = 253
		which is divisible by 11.
</pre>

## 11 Emirp  number

<pre>
Emirp  number is a number which is prime when read backwards and frontwards.
		For Example : 13 is and emirp number
				13 and 31 both are prime numbers.
</pre>
[Solution 11](https://github.com/rahulascii/numbers/blob/master/emirp.java)


## 12 Automorphic number

<pre>
An automorphic number is a number which is present in the last digit(s) of its square.
		For example: 25 is an automorphic number.
		        	Its square is 625 and 25 is present as the last digits.
</pre>
[Solution 12](https://github.com/rahulascii/numbers/blob/master/automorphic.java)


## 13 Prime Palindrome

<pre>
A prime palindrome integer is a positive integer (without leading zeros) which is prime as well as a palindrome.
		For example : 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, etc.
